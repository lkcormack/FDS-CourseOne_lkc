## Windows users
On Windows, we are going to install (if necessary) and use the **W**indows **S**ubsystem for **L**inux, or WSL. 

### Check if WSL is installed

* Open the Windows PowerShell/Shell
* type `wsl <return>`

If the prompt changes and the terminal doesn't complain, you're all set! In the future, whenever we want do things "in the terminal" or "at the command line", just open the PowerShell and type `wsl` to enter the Linux shell.

If WSL is not installed, read on!

### Install WSL
To install WSL, just type `wsl --install` at the PowerShell prompt. The installation may take a few minutes; you can do other stuff while WSL installs.

### Using WSL
Once WSL is installed, you can enter the Linux shell by simply opening a PowerShell window and typing `wsl <return>`. This will put you in a Linux shell, and you can proceed with the tutorial and do any Linux operations you need to do in the future.
