## Python Programming Homework: Functions, Modules, and Namespaces

### Objective:
The purpose of this homework is to reinforce your understanding of functions, namespaces, and Python modules. By the end of the assignment, you should be more familiar with organizing and structuring your Python code using these concepts.

---

### Task Overview:

1. **Function Design for Unit Conversions**: Write functions for basic conversions between imperial and metric units.
2. **Module Creation**: Organize your conversion functions into a custom Python module.
3. **Namespace Exploration**: Demonstrate an understanding of local and global scopes and their implications.

---

### Detailed Requirements:

1. #### Function Design for Unit Conversions:
    - Design and implement functions for the following conversions:
        - Miles to Kilometers and vice versa.
        - Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.
        - Kilograms to Pounds and vice versa.
    - Each conversion should have its dedicated function. For instance, `miles_to_km()`, `km_to_miles()`, etc.
    - Ensure your functions return values up to 2 decimal places for accuracy.

2. #### Module Creation:
    - Organize all the conversion functions you've created into a Python module named `unit_conversions.py`.
    - In a separate script, import your module and demonstrate the use of each function.

3. #### Namespace Exploration:
    - Create a function that demonstrates the difference between local and global scopes. This function should:
        - Declare a local variable.
        - Attempt to modify a global variable.
        - Print the values of local and global variables to demonstrate their interaction.
    - Outside the function, test and demonstrate the concept of global and local scopes based on the interactions observed.

---

### Hints and Tips:

- Ensure each function handles user input effectively and returns results in a clear format.
- Test each function thoroughly to ensure accurate conversions.
- Comment your code.

---

###  Submission Guidelines:

1. Your main script demonstrating the use of your module.
2. The `unit_conversions.py` module containing your functions.

---

### Assessment Criteria:

- Accurate implementation of the conversion functions.
- Proper organization and structuring of your custom module.
- Code readability, including the use of comments and appropriate naming conventions.
- Correct demonstration of local vs. global variable scopes.
- Effective demonstration and testing of each function in your main script.

### Conclusion:
This homework is an opportunity for you to apply key concepts from our recent lessons. Focus on writing clear, concise functions, and ensure you understand the nuances of namespaces. Best of luck, and enjoy the process!
