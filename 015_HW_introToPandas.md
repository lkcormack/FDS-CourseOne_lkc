### Homework on Pandas Basics

---

#### Series Exercises:

1. **Create a Series:**
   - Create a Series named `fruits` with the data: 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', and assign it an index of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' respectively.
   - Print the Series.

2. **Accessing Elements:**
   - Print the second element of the `fruits` Series using both label-based and integer-based indexing.

3. **Series Operations:**
   - Create a Series with the squares of the numbers 1 through 5. 
   - Add 10 to each item in the series.

#### Index Exercises:

4. **Index Attributes:**
   - Print the index of the `fruits` Series created earlier.
   - Check if the index is monotonically increasing.

5. **Modifying Index:**
   - Change the index of the `fruits` Series to 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h' and print the Series.

#### DataFrame Exercises:

6. **Create a DataFrame:**
   - Create a DataFrame named `students` with the columns: 'Name', 'Age', 'Grade'.
   - Populate it with data for three fictional students.

7. **Accessing Data:**
   - Print the `Name` column of the `students` DataFrame.
   - Print the row for the second student.

8. **Conditional Access:**
   - Print all students who are older than 20.

9. **DataFrame Operations:**
   - Add a new column to the `students` DataFrame named `Graduated`, which should be `True` if the student's grade is 'A' and `False` otherwise.
   - Print the updated DataFrame.

10. **Aggregations:**
   - Calculate and print the average age of the students.

11. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the `students` DataFrame based on the `Age` column in descending order and print it.
