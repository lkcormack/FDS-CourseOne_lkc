### Homework on Pandas Basics

---

#### Series Exercises:

1. **Create a Series:**
   - Create a Series named `fruits` with the data: 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', and assign it an index of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' respectively.
   - Print the Series.
   - Print the `Index` of the series.
   
2. **Accessing Elements:**
   - Print the second  ("b") element of the `fruits` Series.

3. **Series Operations:**
   - Create a Series with the squares of the numbers 1 through 5. 
   - Add 10 to each item in the series (hint: there a *method* to this madness).

#### DataFrame Exercises:

1. **Create a DataFrame:**
   - Create a DataFrame named `students` with the columns: 'Name', 'Age', 'Grade'.
   - Populate it with data for three fictional students.

2. **Accessing Data:**
   - Print the `Name` column of the `students` DataFrame.
   
4. **DataFrame Operations:**
   
   - Add a new column to the `students` DataFrame named `Graduated`, which should be `True` if the student's grade is 'A' and `False` otherwise.
   - Print the updated DataFrame.
   
5. **Maths:**
   
   - Calculate and print the average age of the students.
   
6. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the `students` DataFrame based on the `Age` column in descending order and print it.

7. **Tidy Data**.
   - Re-make the cognitive health data frame from class so it is "tidy", with each column as variable and each row an observation.
   - Compute the mean and standard deviation of all variables.
   - Compute the mean and standard error for the happiness variable (there might even be a method for computing standard error...).
