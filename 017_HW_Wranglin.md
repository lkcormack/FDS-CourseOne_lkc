  \- Alternatively can you think ways to use Pandas' `data frame` methods to populate the rows of your data frame flexibly? This means, that the length of the rows can change depending on the number of trials colelcted. Use the cell below to show your solution.

  

Hint. Pandas' [`series.repeat`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.repeat.html) might be a good start, if you prefer to use Pandas' instead of loops to make the code flexible that would be totally fine!
