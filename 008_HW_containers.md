### Python Homework: Data Structures and Indexing

#### Objective:
In this assignment, you'll practice indexing strings, tuples, and lists, 
including lists of lists. You'll also work with sets and dictionaries to 
become familiar with basic operations and applications.

---

#### 1. Indexing Strings:
Given the string `s = "PYTHON"`, retrieve and print the following:

a) The first character  
b) The last character  
c) The substring "PYT"  
d) The substring "HON"

---

#### 2. Indexing Tuples:
Given the tuple `t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)`, retrieve and print the 
following:

a) The first element  
b) The last two elements  
c) The elements from index 1 to index 3 (both inclusive)

---

#### 3. Indexing Lists:
Given the list `lst = [5, 15, 25, [35, 45, [55, 65, 75], 85], 95]`, 
retrieve and print the following:

a) The first element  
b) The last element  
c) The number `65`  
d) The sublist `[55, 65, 75]`

---

#### 4. Lists of Lists:
Consider a 3x3 matrix represented as a list of lists:

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

a) Retrieve the second row.  
b) Retrieve the third column.  
c) Change the center element to 0 and print the modified matrix.

---

#### 5. Using Sets:
Given two lists `A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]` and `B = [4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 
8]`:

a) Create sets from both lists.  
b) Find the union of the two sets.  
c) Find the intersection of the two sets.  
d) Find the elements that are in A but not in B.

---

#### 6. Working with Dictionaries:
Consider the following dictionary that represents the stock of items in a 
store:

```python
stock = {
    "apple": 50,
    "banana": 25,
    "orange": 30,
    "grape": 45
}
```

a) Retrieve the stock of `apple`.  
b) Add a new fruit, `pear`, with a stock of 40.  
c) Update the stock of `banana` to 30.  
d) Remove `orange` from the stock.  
e) Print all the fruits in the store.  
f) Print all the stock values in the store.

#### Tips:
- Remember to handle potential errors when working with indexing.
- Use the Python documentation as a reference for set and dictionary 
operations.

#### Submission:
Once you've completed the exercises, submit your Python code file with 
your solutions. Make sure to test your code to ensure it produces the 
expected outputs!
