### **Python Programming Assignment: Basic Statistics Tool**

**Objective:**  
The goal of this assignment is to provide you with a hands-on experience in collecting user input, performing calculations on data, and structuring code using functions and modules.

---

**Task Overview:**

You will create a simple statistics tool that allows users to:
1. Input a series of numbers.
2. Compute basic statistics on these numbers, including the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.
3. Calculate the z-score for a newly entered observation.
4. Display a summary of the statistics.

---

**Detailed Requirements:**

1. **Data Collection:**
    - Allow users to input numbers one by one.
    - The user should type 'done' when they have finished inputting numbers.

2. **Computational Options:**
    - Provide options to compute:
        - Mean
        - Standard Deviation
        - Standard Error
        - Z-score of a new observation
        - Summary of the statistics

3. **Modules and Functions:**
    - Create a module named `{your_initials}_stats_module.py`.
    - This module should contain functions to compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, standard error, and z-score.

4. **User Interface:**
    - The main script should present users with a menu to choose the various computational options or to input a new set of numbers.
    - The program should continue running until the user decides to quit.

**Hints and Tips:**

- Remember the formulae:
    - **Mean:** Average of all numbers.
    - **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean.
    - **Standard Deviation:** The square root of variance.
    - **Standard Error:** Standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations.
    - **Z-score:** The number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above or below the mean.

- Use lists to store the numbers inputted by the user.

- Use a loop to continuously present the menu to the user and to allow for multiple computations.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. Your main script (e.g., `{your_initials}_stats_tool.py`).
2. The `{your_initials}_stats_module.py.py` file containing your statistical functions.
3. A brief README explaining how to run your tool and any additional features or notes you wish to include.

---

**Assessment Criteria:**

- Correctness and completeness of the functions in the module.
- Proper implementation of the menu and user input features in the main script.
- Code readability and organization.
- Handling of edge cases and user input errors is a bonus but not required for this assignment.
