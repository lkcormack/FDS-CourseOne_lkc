## Python Looping Homework Assignment

### Part 1: For Loops with Lists and Range

#### 1. Lists:

a) Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints each number multiplied by 2.

Example Input: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

Example Output:
```
4
8
12
16
```

b) Given a list of strings, write a program that prints out each string in reverse order without reversing the list itself.

Example Input: `["apple", "pear", "kiwi", "grape"]`

Example Output:
```
grape
kiwi
pear
apple
```

#### 2. Using the range() function:

a) Write a program that uses a `for` loop and the `range()` function to print numbers 0 through 9.

b) Create a program that prints out the first 10 even numbers using the `range()` function.

c) Use the `range()` function to print numbers from 5 to 15.

### Part 2: Dictionaries and Loops

a) Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their favorite colors. Write a program that prints out each student's name and their favorite color.

Example Output:
```
Alex's favorite color is Blue.
Jordan's favorite color is Green.
Taylor's favorite color is Red.
```

b) Given a dictionary with product names as keys and their quantities as values, write a program that doubles the quantity of each product and prints out the updated quantities.

Example Input: `{"apple": 5, "banana": 3, "cherries": 10}`

Example Output:
```
apple now has 10.
banana now has 6.
cherries now have 20.
```

### Part 3: Storing Results of a For Loop in a New List and List Comprehensions

a) Write a program that takes a list of numbers and creates a new list with each number multiplied by 2.

Example Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`

Example Output (new list): `[2, 6, 10, 14]`

b) Given a list of words, create a new list that contains the first letter of each word.

Example Input: `["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"]`

Example Output (new list): `["A", "B", "C", "D"]`

c) Use a list comprehension to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

d) Given a list of words, use a list comprehension to create a new list containing the last letter of each word.

Example Input: `["apple", "pear", "kiwi", "grape"]`

Expected Output: `["e", "r", "i", "e"]`
