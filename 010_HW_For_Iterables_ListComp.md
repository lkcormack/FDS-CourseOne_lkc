## Python Looping Homework Assignment

### Part 1: For Loops

#### 1. Lists:

a) Write a program that takes a list of numbers and prints out each number squared.

Example Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

Example Output:
```
1
4
9
16
```

b) Given a list of strings, write a program that prints only those strings which are greater than 4 characters in length.

Example Input: `["apple", "pear", "kiwi", "grape"]`

Example Output:
```
apple
grape
```

#### 2. Tuples:

a) Create a tuple with five different fruits. Write a program that loops through the tuple and prints each fruit with its index.

Example Output:
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
3 date
4 elderberry
```

b) Write a program that takes a tuple of numbers. Calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in the tuple.

Example Input: `(10, 21, 32, 43, 54)`

Example Output: `96`

#### 3. Dictionaries:

a) Create a dictionary where the keys are country names and the values are their capitals. Write a program that prints out the country and its capital in the following format: "The capital of [Country] is [Capital]."

Example Output:
```
The capital of Germany is Berlin.
The capital of France is Paris.
```

b) Given a dictionary where keys are product names and values are their prices, write a program that prints out all products that cost more than $10.

Example Input: `{"apple": 0.5, "banana": 0.25, "cherries": 3, "dragonfruit": 15}`

Example Output:
```
dragonfruit costs $15.
```

### Part 2: While Loops

1. Create a program that starts with the number 10 and decrements by 1 after each iteration, printing out the current number. Stop the loop when the number reaches 0.

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. If the user enters a number outside of this range, the program should continue prompting them until they enter a valid number.

3. Create a guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 50. The user has to guess the number. The program should provide feedback such as "Too high" or "Too low" after each guess. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number or after 5 attempts.
