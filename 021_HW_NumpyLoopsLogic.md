Of course! Here's a draft of the homework. Please feel free to make any modifications to suit your needs:

---

**Homework: Loops and Logical Testing with NumPy**

**Objective:** To understand and implement for loops, while loops, and logical testing and comparison with NumPy arrays.

**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of Python, NumPy library, and loop structures.

---

**Problem 1: Basic Array Comparisons**

Given the following NumPy array:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6, 7])
```

Write a Python script that checks and prints which elements of the array are even.

---

**Problem 2: Sum of Array Elements**

Given a 1D NumPy array of arbitrary length, write a Python script that calculates and prints the sum of its elements without using any built-in NumPy functions.

---

**Problem 3: Nested For Loops with 2D Arrays**

Consider the following 2D NumPy array:
```python
import numpy as np
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Write a Python script that:
1. Multiplies each element of the matrix by 2.
2. Prints the new matrix.

Hint: Use nested for loops to iterate over rows and columns of the 2D array.

---

**Problem 4: While Loop Within a For Loop**

Given a list of NumPy arrays:
```python
arrays_list = [np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]), np.array([5, 15, 25]), np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])]
```

Write a Python script that:
1. Iterates over each array in the list using a for loop.
2. For each array, starts at the first element and sums consecutive elements using a while loop until the sum is greater than or equal to 50. The script should print the sum and the index where it stopped for each array.

---

**Problem 5: Logical Testing with NumPy**

Given a 2D NumPy array:
```python
data = np.array([[5, 8, 3], [7, 2, 9], [6, 4, 1]])
```

Write a Python script that:
1. Identifies and prints the location (row and column) of all elements that are greater than 6.
2. Calculates the mean of the entire array without using the `np.mean()` function.

---

**Bonus Problem: Advanced Array Operations**

Consider the following 1D NumPy arrays:
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
```

Using only loops and logical operations (i.e., no direct use of built-in NumPy array functions), compute and print:
1. The dot product of `a` and `b`.
2. The element-wise product of `a` and `b`.

---

**Submission:** Please submit your Python scripts along with the outputs for each problem.



Sure! One of the primary advantages of NumPy is its ability to handle vectorized operations, meaning it can process whole arrays at once without the need for explicit loops. This often makes operations faster and more readable. However, when a computation relies on sequential decisions that can't be vectorized, or when the computation for an element depends on the result of a computation for a previous element, a loop becomes necessary.

Here's an example problem that falls into this category:

---

**Problem: Fibonacci Sequence in an Array**

Suppose you have a 1D NumPy array `a` of length `n`, initialized with zeros:
```python
import numpy as np
n = 10
a = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)
```

Your task is to fill this array with the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

However, there's a catch: **you cannot use any built-in NumPy functions or any Python lists**. You must use a `for` loop to fill in the values sequentially.

---

The reason why this problem is better approached with a loop rather than NumPy vectorized functions is because each value in the sequence depends on the previous two values. This sequential dependency prevents the operation from being easily vectorized.
