#### and how we arrived at our current computing infrastructure

Humans have used computing since ancient times. The first step was *external information storage and calculation*.

##### The astrolab



##### Babagge



##### Eniac



##### Mainframes



#####  The “PC”



#### The Operating System (OS)



##### DOS

#### File systems

One of the primary jobs of an operation system (OS) is to maintain all the files on the computer, including applications, files used or created by applications, files used by the operating system itself, and **your** files in a neat, organized, efficient way. Of course, it’s primarily your job to, as the intelligent user of your computer, to keep your own files organized in a way that works for you – the OS can only help you so much!

Three analogies

* root & branch
* magic mansion
* family tree

#### The Cloud (network file servers)

Logical extensions to the file system that provide additional “disk space” in remote locations.
